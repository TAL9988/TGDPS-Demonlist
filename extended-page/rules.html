    <h2>Submitting Your Level to the List</h2>
    <li>Records show that you have completed a level on the list.</li>
    <li>Your record should be sent through either YouTube, Twitch or Google Drive.</li>
    <li>dont hack!</li>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <li>Any record run must begin at the start of the level and continue until the end of the level. A record is still valid even if you get 0 deaths and 100% accuracy in Noclip Accuracy or just use one attempt in Practice Mode.</li>
    <li>It is necessary that there are <b>audible clicks</b> present throughout the entire run, whether the footage is finished or raw. A record without clicks will definitely be disregarded! <b>mobile players</b> are exempt from this rule for easier levels on the list.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Bannable Punishments</h2>
    <li>Show Hitboxes On Death IS allowed. Other than that its just common sense, dont use things that are commonly considered hacks, Noclip, Hitboxes, etc.</li>
